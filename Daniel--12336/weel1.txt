What is Software Engineering

Software engineering is the systematic process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It applies engineering principles to ensure software is 
reliable, efficient, and meets user requirements. Unlike simple programming, software engineering involves careful planning, teamwork, and the use of standardized methods to manage 
complexity in large projects. It covers various stages such as requirement analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The goal is to produce high-quality software 
that performs effectively in real-world conditions. Software engineering also emphasizes documentation, version control, and quality assurance, ensuring that software systems are scalable, 
secure, and easy to update.
